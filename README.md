<h2>Concepts learned from this project</h2>

-Sending an asynchronous JavaScript request using a REST API to OpenWeatherMap to request weather information for a specific location.  </br></br>
-Installing npm to the project as a package manager to automatically install 3rd party packages and keep them up to date.  </br></br>
-Using webpack as a module bundler to create a single script file in the dist folder.  </br></br>
-Splitting webpack configurations into a development and production version which can be run with an npm script to make debugging possible in a dev server.</br></br>
-Using a transpiler called Babel to be able to use keywords such as 'import' and 'require', and extra JavaScript features such as SCSS instead of CSS.  </br></br>
-Used npm task runner features to make some tasks such as running webpack and deploying to github pages subdirectory faster.  </br></br>
-Added an import statement in index.js to be able to use SCSS for nesting, variables, and & operators in CSS sheets.  </br></br>
